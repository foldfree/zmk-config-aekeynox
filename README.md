# Ækeynox

Reference ZMK implementation of the [Arsenik] and [Selenium] keymaps.

![ortholinear view of the Selenium keymap](https://github.com/OneDeadKey/selenium/raw/main/selenium.png)

Customize your keymap once, and build it on many keebs.

## In a Nutshell

This repository allows to build your firmware with GitHub Actions (GHA):

1. [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don’t already have one
2. [fork](https://github.com/OneDeadKey/zmk-config-aekeynox/fork) this repository
3. set your configuration in [`keymaps/settings.h`](#keymapssettingsh)<br>
   *(this step is **required** for non-QWERTY layouts)*
4. make sure your keyboard is configured properly in [`build.yaml`](#buildyaml)<br>
   *(this step is **required** for composite keebs based on Pro Micro, XIAO, etc.)*
5. save, commit, push

Your firmware will now be built automatically by GitHub’s CI:

- check the `Actions` tab
- wait for the latest task to complete
- click on this task
- download the CI artifact
- unzip, pick the firmware matching your keeb
- flash your keeb


## Configuration

### `keymaps/settings.h`

This is where options can be safely selected. This file should be self-explanatory,
but here are the main options:

- `HT_*` selects the Selenium hold-tap flavor: [EZ], [TT], [HRM] (default), [2TK].

- `KB_LAYOUT_*` must match the layout used on the host computer.<br>
  If unset, QWERTY is assumed, which **will** result in unexpected symbols or shortcuts
  if a different keyboard layout is used.

- `KB_EMULATION_*` (experimental) activates a layout emulation (none by default).

- `VIM_NAVIGATION` enables the [Vim variant](https://onedeadkey.github.io/selenium/#vim-variant).

[EZ]:  https://onedeadkey.github.io/selenium/#flavor-ez
[TT]:  https://onedeadkey.github.io/selenium/#flavor-tt
[HRM]: https://onedeadkey.github.io/selenium/#flavor-hrm
[2TK]: https://onedeadkey.github.io/selenium/#flavor-2tk

### `keymaps/selenium.keymap`

This file allows low-level customization.

See the [customizing ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/customization) documentation.

### `build.yaml`

This is the list of all keyboard firmware to build.

Most DIY keebs consist in two parts:
- a *shield*, which is the physical keyboard with the keys;
- a *board*, which is the controller plugged onto the keeb: SparkFun, nice!nano, XIAO, etc.

If your keeb uses such a controller board, make sure it’s properly described in this file.
You might have to change the `board` field to match the micro-controller unit associated with your keeb.

If your keeb has an onboard controller, there’s nothing to configure.

### `config/*.keymap`

These are the keyboard descriptors. The folder name can be confusing, but that’s how ZMK works.


## Layout Emulation

This is still pre-alpha. So far only two layouts can be emulated: Dvorak and Ergo‑L.

To emulate Dvorak for QWERTY hosts, just uncomment this line in `keymaps/settings.h`:

```c
#define KB_EMULATION_DVORAK
```

To emulate Ergo‑L for AZERTY hosts, uncomment these two lines:

```c
#define KB_LAYOUT_AZERTY
#define KB_EMULATION_ERGOL
```

To emulate Ergo‑L for QWERTY-intl hosts, thus enabling accented uppercase chars,
uncomment these two lines:

```c
#define KB_LAYOUT_QWERTY_INTL
#define KB_EMULATION_ERGOL
```

This feature is being actively developed: feedback and patches are very welcome.


## Why the name?

Any name containing `key` and easy to search would’ve been a good fit, but here’s Nox:
